          E-sports as a learning medium
        </h3>
        <p class="text">
          In a digital world where children spend increasingly more time in front of the screen it is natural to question if they are
          wasting their time and better off doing other activites. E-sport is the future community for children who gather
          around the game, the competition, social intercourse and the healthy competetion. We believe e-sport is the key
          to activate and acknowledge a large group of children who are often overlooked. Research in computergaming among
          youngsters has established a clear connection between reflective use of games and an increased understanding of
          life skills such as problem solving, collaboration, linguistic skills and much more.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Through pedagogical correct and impactful e-sports coaching by skilled and certified e-instructors we establish a strong
          foundation for mental- and social health. All of our courses are based on a related life skill that we help the
          players evolve during their games hence providing them with a solid skillset that can be used in real life as well.

                  <h3>21st Century Skills</h3>
                  <p class="text">
                      21st century skills comprise skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators,
                      business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies. This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills
                      required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, digital society. Many of these skills are also
                      associated with deeper learning, which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork.
                      These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based
