        E-sports as a learning medium
      </h3>
      <p class="text">
        In a digital world where children spend increasingly more time in front of the screen it is natural to question if they are
        wasting their time and better off doing other activites. E-sport is the future community for children who gather
        around the game, the competition, social intercourse and the healthy competetion. We believe e-sport is the key to
        activate and acknowledge a large group of children who are often overlooked. Research in computergaming among youngsters
        has established a clear connection between reflective use of games and an increased understanding of life skills
        such as problem solving, collaboration, linguistic skills and much more.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Through pedagogical correct and impactful e-sports coaching by skilled and certified e-instructors we establish a strong
        foundation for mental- and social health. All of our courses are based on a related life skill that we help the players
        evolve during their games hence providing them with a solid skillset that can be used in real life as well.

      <h3>21st Century Skills</h3>
      <p class="text">
        21st century skills comprise skills, abilities, and learning dispositions that have been identified as being required for
        success in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, academics, and governmental agencies.
        This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation
        for success in a rapidly changing, digital society. Many of these skills are also associated with deeper learning,
        which is based on mastering skills such as analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork. These skills
        differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based

    <h3>Synlig Læring</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="text">
        Uanset hvor I verden du undervises, er et koncept vigtigere end nogensinde før i undervisning. Synlig læring
        har ét formål; at gøre undervisningen transparent for alle. Idéen bag synlig læring er, at dem som
        undervise, hele tiden har et overblik over hvor de er, hvor de er på vej hen, og hvad målet for
        undervisningen er.
    </p>
    <p class="text">

        Hos GamerPilot gør vi det samme. Synlig læring er integreret i alle vores videokurser, for at sikre det højest
        mulige udbytte af undervisningen. Vores undervisere er bekendte med moderne læringsteori og sørger for,
        at der undervises akkurat efter samme principper, som på en moderne undervisningsinstitution.

      <h3>Internal Motivation</h3>
      <p class="text">
        A rich literature of emotional intelligence studies and reports are clearly showing the advantages of being internally motivated
        to learn, as opposed to learning just for external motivations such as parental approval or performance on tests.
        When people have an emotional connection to what is being learned— a personal experience or question—learning can
        be sustained longer, understanding can become deeper, and what is learned can be retained longer. Studies of well-designed
        learning proj- ects geared to student interests and passions also show that internal motivation can contribute a
        great deal to active engagement, deeper understanding, and a desire to learn more

      <h3>Authentic Learning</h3>
      <p class="text">
        Context, or the conditions in which learning activities occur (the people, objects, symbols, and environment and how they
        all work together to support learning), are much more influential than previously thought. Transferring what is learned
        from one context to another (such as from the computerplay to the real world) is often not successful. Doing supermarket
        math problems on a test is different from mentally calculating price differences of three kinds and sizes of laundry
        soap in an actual store. The setting in which a new skill or piece of knowledge is learned strongly influences whether
        or not that skill or knowledge can be applied elsewhere. Simulating the real-world environment with media or by actually
        being in a place where that particular skill or knowledge is used in the world—supplying a more authentic context
        for learning— increases the chance that a lesson will be remembered and can be used in other similar situations.
        This finding suggests students need more real-world problem solving, internships or apprenticeships in real work
        settings, and other more authentic learning experiences to make learning last and be useful.

      <h3>Mental Model Building</h3>
      <p class="text">
        A great deal has been learned about how people build mental models, incorporate new experiences into these models, and change
        these models over time. We all start with less than accurate mental models of the world based on our experience (the
        Earth sure looks flat to me) and adjust them as we encounter new experiences that don’t quite fit (wow, the Earth
        looks like a giant floating blue-and-white marble in those photos from space). The building and changing of our mental
        models, and how we link our mental models together in our heads—our shifting systems view of the world—is much of
        what learning is all about.
      </p>
      <p class="text">

        Recognizing what you already know from past experience and what you currently believe from the latest versions of your mental
        models—are important first steps in the learning process. Unfortunately, in our haste to teach new material, the
        important step of helping learners reflect on their current mental models is often overlooked.
      </p>

      <p class="text">

        Building and manipulating external models, whether they’re physical ones (wood or LEGO blocks, robotic parts, and the like)
        or virtual ones (drawings on paper or screens, computer simulations like The Sims or Spore, virtual worlds like Second
        Life, videogames, and so on) help us visualize and further develop our internal mental models.
      </p>
      <p class="text">


        Both visceral (hands-on) and virtual (on-screen) modeling activities provide ways to make thinking visible, refl ecting the
        internal model making and learning going on inside our heads.
